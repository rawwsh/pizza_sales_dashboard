# üçï Pizza Sales Project ‚Äì SQL & Power BI  

## üìå Overview  
The **Pizza Sales Project** is an end-to-end data analysis and visualization project designed to explore and optimize sales performance for a fictional pizza restaurant chain.  
It leverages **SQL** for data extraction and transformation, and **Power BI** for creating interactive dashboards.  
The ultimate goal is to generate insights that can guide decision-making, improve sales, and boost customer satisfaction.

## üîπ Project Workflow  

### 1. Data Acquisition  
- Raw sales data is collected from multiple sources such as databases, CSV files, or data warehouses.  
- Typical data includes:  
  - Customer orders  
  - Pizza/product details  
  - Order dates & timestamps  
  - Transaction amounts  

### 2. Data Transformation (SQL)  
- Data is cleaned, filtered, and reshaped into an analysis-ready format using SQL.  
- Common tasks include:  
  - Table joins  
  - Aggregations  
  - Handling null/missing values  
  - Creating calculated fields  

### 3. Data Analysis  
Key SQL queries are used to answer critical business questions, such as:  
- Which pizzas are the **top sellers**?  
- What are the **sales trends** across days, weeks, or months?  
- How do **customer preferences** vary?  
- What is the **average order value**?  
- Which **locations** perform best?  

### 4. Data Visualization (Power BI)  
Interactive dashboards in Power BI bring the analysis to life, including:  
- **Bar & pie charts** ‚Üí Sales breakdown by pizza type or category  
- **Time-series charts** ‚Üí Sales growth & seasonal trends  
- **Geo maps** ‚Üí Performance by restaurant location  
- **KPI dashboards** ‚Üí At-a-glance business performance  

üìä **Sample Dashboards:**  
- Dashboard 1 ‚Äì Sales Overview  
- Dashboard 2 ‚Äì Location & Product Performance  

### 5. Insights & Recommendations  
The dashboards and queries provide actionable insights that help the pizza chain:  
- Optimize product offerings  
- Adjust marketing campaigns  
- Improve location-specific performance  
- Enhance customer satisfaction & retention
